This post marks the first of what could be an inconsistent rambling blog! I have a tendency to be mildly cynical and apathetic and I'm the last person who needs a blog, but my writing needs some practice. Having graduated from college I need some way to keep from getting rusty since I don't write much at work. So here I may write about books, I may write about tech, I may even practice some poetry, or maybe it'll fall to ruin as I forget about it in a week. So abandon all hope, this won't be too exciting.
